\title{The simple Weighted Sum method}
\usage{
WS_noninteractive(criteria.weights, alternatives.performance)
}
\arguments{
\item{{criteria.weights}}{{a numerical vector with named elements correspoding to the criteria
which provides the user's preference weights of the criteria (in any common scale)}}

\item{{alternatives.performance}}{{ a numerical matrix with row names corresponding to the alternatives that are to be evaluated
and column names corresponding to the criteria which for each alternative provides a value (in any common scale) for its performance with respect to each criterion}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item\code{Weights} {a vector which contains subjective preference weights of the criteria as specified by the user}
\item\code{Table} {a matrix which corresponds to the subjective performance estimation of the alternatives with respect to the criteria as provided by the user and, in addition, contains the criteria weights as provided by the user, and the scores computed by the weighted sum heuristic for all alternatives}
\item\code{Scores} {a vector which for each alternative provides the weighted sum scores for the alternatives as computed by the process}
\item\code{Order} {a vector which contains the numbering (index) of the alternatives in decreasing order}
}
}
\description{
Provides for input of subjective user judgements and suppsequently applies
the simple Weighted Sum method in order to obtain ranking scores for the alternatives.
}
\details{
The function requires the
package \code{MCDA} which provides implementation of the \code{weightedSum} function.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

## Specify names of the criteria

crit <- c("housing", "salary", "career", "recreation")

## Specify names of the alternatives to be evaluated

alt <-c("Stockholm", "Lulea", "Boden", "Malmoe", "Gothenburg")

## Assign  (subjective) preference weights to criteria

criteria.weights <- c(4, 10, 7, 3)
names(criteria.weights) <- crit

## Create matrix to insert (subjective) performance measure of each alternative w.r.t. each criterion

alternatives.performance <- matrix(nrow = length(alt), ncol = length(crit))
colnames(alternatives.performance) <- crit
rownames(alternatives.performance) <- alt
alternatives.performance[,] <- NaN
alternatives.performance <- fix(alternatives.performance)

## AfteÅ• inserting (subjective) values, it should look something like this:


alternatives.performance
              housing salary career recreation
Stockholm        4      8      7          9
Lulea            5      9      6          5
Boden            8      9      6          3
Malmoe           3      7      8          8
Gothenburg       5      7      7          7

## Evaluate using Weighted Sum heuristic

res <- WS_noninteractive(criteria.weights, alternatives.performance)

## View the runking result

res$Scores
Stockholm      Lulea      Boden     Malmoe Gothenburg
    172        167        173        162        160

res$Order
3 1 2 4 5

## Sort the alternatives according to this order

alt[res$Order]
"Boden"      "Stockholm"  "Lulea"      "Malmoe"     "Gothenburg"

## or sort as follows

res$Scores[res$Order]
Boden  Stockholm      Lulea     Malmoe Gothenburg
173        172        167        162        160
